Hi, I’m @rileyelwell and I love game development, more specifically, game design! I know C/C++/C#, Python, and web development (HTML, CSS, JS). I have experience with Unity, and am developing my skills with Blender and Unreal Engine. I am currently a student and pursuing a career in the gaming industry.
